## Description

This project is a note taker project which utilized express.js in the backend following the CRUD acronym. The user can create a new note that will be saved, the note can also be deleted if the user wishes to delete the note. The most challenging part of this project was for me, creating routers using expresses ROUTER() method, but once I overcame that challenge it was a big relief and it helped me grow and actually understand why routing is used and how to use it with a deeper understanding. Another challenge that I faced was creating the functionality for the methods, but utilizing the resources I have at hand I got it and it taught me more was of going about handling javascript code.
